# Document
* The *subject* of a document is defined as the topic of the document.

* The *subject* is tightly connected to the tag [*title*](title.md "title.md").

# Examples

* Invoice: Invoice number
* Manual: Topic
* Contract: Contract number of topic of the contract.
* Order: Ordernumber

## Filename
* Some part of the filename is build from the subject part. When the title matches some abbreviation definition, the subject will be added behind that abbreviation. Otherwise the title and subject will be listed separately in the filename.

# Exif
* The subject is stored in the metatag *subject* within the exif information of a PDF document.
