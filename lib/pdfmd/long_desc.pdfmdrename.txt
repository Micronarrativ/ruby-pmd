== Hiera

--- #YAML
pdfmd::config:
  rename:
    dryrun      : true|false
    allkeywords : true|false
    outputdir   : /tmp
    nrkeywords  : 3
    copy        : true|false
    log         : true|false
    logfile     : /var/log/pdfmd.log



== Example

# Rename the file according to the metatags

$ pdfmd rename <filename>

# Rename example.pdf according to the metatags

$ pdfmd rename example.pdf

# Simulate renaming example.pdf according to the metatags (dry-run)
$ pdfmd rename -n example.pdf



== Hiera

There are Hiera settings available, that cannot be addressed by a commandline parameter.

defaultdoctype: Defines the appreviation for the default document type. This one isused when no other document type could be determined from the metadata-field 'title'. Default value is 'doc'.

For details on how to set the parameter, see 'pdfmd explain hiera'.


== Rules

There are some rules regarding how documents are being renamed

Rule 1: All documents have the following filenaming structure:

<yyyymmdd>-<author>-<type>-<additionalInformation>.<extension>

# <yyyymmdd>: Year, month and day identical to the meta information in the document.

# <author>: Author of the document, identical to the meta information
in the document. Special characters and whitespaces are replaced.

# <type>: Document type, is being generated from the title field in the metadata of the document. Document type is a three character abbreviation following the following logic:

con => Contract

inv => Invoice

inf => Information

man => Manual

off => Offer

ord => Order

rpt => Receipt

tic => Ticket

If the dokument type can not be determined automatically, it defaults to 'dok'.

This default behavior got introduced with version 1.8.1 and can be overwritten by hiera.
See `pdfmd explain hiera-keys` for information on how to do this.

# <additionalInformation>: Information generated from the metadata fields
'title', 'subject' and 'keywords'. 

If 'Title' or 'Keywords' contains one of the following keywords, they will be replaced with the corresponding abbreviation followed by the specified value:

Contract    => con

Invoice     => inv

Information => inf

Manual      => man

Offer       => off

Order       => ord

Receipt     => rpt

Ticket      => tic


This setting will be overwritten as well by defining the 'keys' hash in Hiera.

Rule 2: The number of keywords used in the filename is defined by the parameter '-k'. See the section of that parameter for more details and the default value.

Rule 3: Keywords matching 'kvi','fak','ord','kdn' are prioritised.

Rule 4: Special characters and whitespaces are replaced: 

' ' => '_'

'/' => '_'

Rule 5: The new filename has only lowercase characters.

# Example PDF with following MetaTags:

Filename   : example.pdf

Subject    : new Product

Title      : Presentation

CreateDate : 1970:01:01 01:00:00

Keywords   : John Doe, Jane Doe, Mister Doe


# Renaming the file

$ pdfmd rename example.pdf

example.pdf => 19700101-john-dok-new_product-john_doe-jane_doe.pdf



# Simulation to rename the file (no actual change)

pdfmd rename -n example.pdf

example.pdf => 19700101-john-dok-new_product-john_doe-jane_doe.pdf



# Renaming the file with all keywords

$ pdfmd rename -n -a example.pdf

example.pdf => 19700101-john-dok-new_product-john_doe-jane_doe-mister_doe.pdf
