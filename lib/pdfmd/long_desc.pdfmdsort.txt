== General

Will sort pdf documents into subdirectories according to the value of the meta-tag 'author'.

If a document does not have an entry in the meta tag 'author', the file will not be processed.

=== Parameter

--destination, -d

Speficy the root output directory to where the folderstructure is being created.

This parameter is required if hiera is not configured.

The command line parameter overwrites the hiera defaults

Default: current working directory.



--dryrun, -n

If set to true the command will perform all actions as usual but without actually doing anything. Logentries will be prefaced with 'DRYRUN: ' for all simulated actions. Default: false



--copy, -c

Copy the files instead of moving them. Default: false



--log, -l

Disable/Enable the logging. Default: true



--logfile, -p

Set an alternate path for the logfile. If no path is chosen, the logfile gets created in the current working directory as `.pdfmd.log`.



--interactive, -i

Disable/Enable interactive sorting. This will ask for confirmation for each sorting action. Default: false



--overwrite, -o

If set to 'true' the command will overwrite any existing file at the target destination with the same name without asking. Default: false



--typo, -t

If set to 'true' (or set at all) similar sub-directories in the sorting target directory will be reported before a new folder is being created. Similar sub-directories can be caused by typos in the author field for the document. 



=== Replacement rules

The subdirectories for the documents are generated from the values in the
tag 'author' of each document.

In order to ensure a clean directory structure, there are certain rules
for altering the values.

1. Whitespaces are replaced by underscores.

2. Dots are replaced by underscores.

3. All letters are converted to their lowercase version.

4. Special characters are serialized.



=== Hiera

Set the default values mentioned below as sub-hash of the main configuration:

--- #YAML
pdfmd::config:
  sort:
    copy        : true|false
    destination : /tmp
    dryrun      : true|false
    interactive : true|false
    log         : true|false
    logfile     : /var/log/pdfmd.log
    overwrite   : true|false

See the README file for an example how to define the values in Hiera or run `pdfmd explain hiera`.



=== Example

This command does the following:

1. Take all pdf documents in the subdirectory ./documents.

2. Create the output folder structure in `/tmp/test/`.

3. Copy the files instead of moving them.

4. Disable the logging.

$ pdfmd sort -d /tmp/test -c -l false ./documents

# Sort only a single file

$ pdfmd sort -d /tmp/test -c -l false ./documents/test.pdf
