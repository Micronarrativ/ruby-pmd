[typo]
  Parameter for the command 'sort'.  
  If parameter is set, a warning will appear during the sorting process when a target directory is already present, which is similar to the new one that shall be created.  
  This usually indicates a typo in the author field, which then is reflected in the naming of the sub-directory in the sorting target.  
  The user then can either decide to continue or abort the sorting process.
